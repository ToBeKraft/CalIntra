## Why CalIntra

CalIntra is perfect for anyone who wants to make the most out of their 42 school experience. By streamlining the process of syncing events and logtime, this extension saves you time and effort, allowing you to focus on what really matters: your education and personal growth.

But let's be honest, we hate community service and is pretty bad to get it just for missing an event where you were supposed to be. So, CalIntra is also perfect for those who want to avoid community service.
